# 🌍 World Weather Economic Dashboard

An interactive Tableau project visualizing global weather and economic data for cities around the world.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The dashboard consists of **two main views**:

### 1. **Global Weather & Economy Map**
- Displays cities with weather and cost-of-living data.
- Hover over a city to see:
  - Average temperature
  - Net salary
  - Basic living costs
- Use the **date slider** to filter the map over a 3-year period, accurate to a single day.

### 2. **City-Level Dashboard**
- Clicking on a city opens a detailed dashboard with KPIs and various visualizations.
- Includes comparisons, rankings, and metrics for that specific city.
