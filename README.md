# Tableau Projects 📈

This repository showcases my Tableau projects, focused on interactive dashboards that blend economic and climate data from around the world.

## Projects

1. **World Weather Economic Dashboard 🌍**

   - **Live Dashboard**:  
     [View Tableau Dashboard](https://mateuszmachowina.github.io/tableau/)

   - **Functionality**:
     - A **global interactive map** of cities displaying average temperature and economic indicators like salary, rent, utility costs, and food prices.
     - Hover to explore city data.  
     - Filter the timeline by **day-level precision** over a 3-year range.  
     - **Click on a city** to open a second dashboard with detailed insights, KPIs, and comparisons for that location.

   - **Original Datasets**:
     - 🌡️ [Temperature History of 1000 Cities (1980–2020) – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hansukyang/temperature-history-of-1000-cities-1980-to-2020)
